# <div align="center"> Description </div>
<div align="center"> I created a C# console application for a bakery that includes the following functionality:

A class for Bread and another class for Pastry.

When the user runs the application, they will receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.

The user will be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they would like.

The application will then return the total cost of the order.

Pierre offers the following deals:

Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free (every 3rd loaf of bread is free.). A single loaf costs $5, two loaves costs $10, and three loaves cost $10.
Pastry: Buy 1 for $2 or 3 for $5. Four pastries costs $7, five pastries costs $9, and six pastries costs $10.
